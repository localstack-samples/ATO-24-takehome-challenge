> **_NOTE:_** None of the following commands/actions run against a real AWS Cloud environment. All AWS API requests are directed towards the LocalStack container running on `localhost:4566` on your local machine.

## Scavenger Hunt Instructions:

**Tool Up**: Before diving in, equip yourself with the essentials:

- [The LocalStack CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/)

**Starting LocalStack:** Are you already a LocalStack user? Great! Grab your auth token, and letâ€™s get to work.

`$ export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>`

If you're just joining us, let's start by getting you a token. Simply sign up [here](http://app.localstack.cloud). If you're using a personal email provider, you will be able to choose the Hobbyist plan in the next step. If you are using a work email, please select the 14 day trial option. Once in, you'll need a license. Click [here](https://app.localstack.cloud/workspace/auth-token) to go where you need to be directly. Fret not, there is no payment information required. You'll find your Auth Token in the Workspace section in the left-hand panel. Don't forget to export it as an environment variable.

Fire up your engines by running the following command: `localstack start`

In the unlikely situation of something going wrong, follow the instructions in the output logs.
